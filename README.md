# The atPlatform ancillary services

This repo is intended for packages which complement the core atPlatform, the first of which is
* **_[at_secondary_proxy](packages/at_secondary_proxy/README.md)_** which acts as a TCP reverse proxy for connections from clients to
secondary servers, where the clients are limited to standard ports
